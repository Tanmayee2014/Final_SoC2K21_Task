# Final_SoC2K21_Task

#Check Point 1-

Task 1- In this task we learnt how to import pandas and numpy.
Task 2- In this task we plotted different histograms, various plots. Also we learnt about statistical different datasets.

#CheckPoint 2-

Task 1&2- We learnt many libraries from the OpenCV. We make a code using OpenCV for finding the gender and age of a person.we learnt basic of computer vision and deep learning with OpenCV. For me it was difficult to understand the OpenCV. So I asked by doubts to our mentor and also search more about OpenCV and that’s how I cleared my concepts. And using all this knowledge in checkpoint 2 we made a code which can use our laptop’s webcam and predict our age in some range and our gender.

CheckPoint 3-

Task 1- We learnt TensorFlow lite and their examples. In this task using different libraries we make a code through which we can recognize the faces from photos and videos.
